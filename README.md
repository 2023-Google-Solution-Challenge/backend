Overview

### Background and Goals
Labor is an act that inevitably accompanies human life. Compared to rapid economic growth, workers' working conditions have not improved noticeably. In the working environment, individual values were decreasing, and they were often not properly respected. Among them, the labor vulnerable groups are prone to discrimination in the labor market and are not guaranteed legitimate rights. Even in the current job market, they are marginalized. In order to promote steady economic growth in the future, securing workers' rights must be a priority.

We divided the problems of the working environment into four categories and focused on the conflicts and solutions that may arise between employers and workers.

- Overdue wages

  Workers may not be properly paid, such as delayed deposit dates or not guaranteed minimum hourly wages. The value of their work should be appropriately compensated.

- Exploitation of labor

  During office hours, individuals are sometimes assigned heavy workloads. As a result, workers are placed in busy and poor working conditions. Follows working hours, lunch hours, and commuting hours.

- Unfair dismissal

  If a worker is fired for no good reason, it becomes difficult to make a living right away. Workers should be notified of their dismissal in advance and fully prepared for the future. Likewise, employers should not be notified of workers' sudden departure.

- Abuse

  Workers are treated unfairly for a variety of reasons while on duty. Even if you go through something unfair, you don't know how to deal with it, so you move on. Wages differences based on gender, race, disability and unfair working conditions should be improved. In addition, both employers and workers need active attention and effort to solve the problem.

Our service provides quality jobs that improve the existing poor working conditions, helping to prevent the value of workers from falling. In addition, considering the position of the employer, it enables better work management and job hunting. Through this, workers are provided with better jobs, and employers aim to create a labor market that is satisfactory to everyone by finding the right workers for the workplace.

### Target
We aim to support and empower vulnerable groups in the labor market, including foreign workers, women, the elderly, person with disabilities, teenagers, and immigrants. Our sub-target is individuals seeking employment.

Our Solution
---
It's a kind of platform service. With the Signs app, jobseekers aim to find more suitable jobs, and employers aim to hire reliable workers. In particular, we've targeted vulnerable groups in the labor environment and added features to the application that are useful in the labor environment so that they can continue to work in a better environment.

For example, before starting work, both employees and employers are required to complete a work contract, ensure commuting hours and breaks, and make it easier to guarantee legally specified workers' rights, such as vacations and weekly holiday allowances. Even if you experience unfair things in your workplace, you can get help from others through the community and guide in the app, and you can also go directly to the reporting page to provide convenience.

You can also identify the "reliability" score in your application to see how reliable your partner is. This will enable employers to build good working areas and gain a reputation. In addition, employees will be able to get jobs in a better environment. Our goal is to achieve the highest reliability score for all users. As a result, quality jobs are created that everyone can trust and trust, which also leads to economic growth.

Signz Features
---
While there are existing job search platforms that connect employers and workers, there is a lack of applications specifically targeting vulnerable labor groups. Signz, however, goes beyond basic job hunting functions and aims to provide workers with reasonable treatment in the appropriate working environment. This includes features such as labor contract management, commute tracking, rest time guarantees, and vacation planning. Additionally, Signz offers guidance on how to deal with workplace unfairness, ensuring that workers' rights are secured.

To address the lack of labor education, Signz provides educational videos on topics such as workers' human rights, safety, disability, and sexual harassment. Users can earn badges based on their viewing activity, which contribute to their reliability score. Unlike other platforms that typically only evaluate workers, Sainz includes employer evaluations in the reliability score, leading to the formation of high-quality labor jobs based on mutual trust between both parties.

Finally, recognizing the lack of community support for business owners, Signz operates separately from the worker and employer communities.




Expected effects
---
Signz aims to create a labor market that satisfies both workers and employers. In particular, targeting workers in the blind spot of the labor market can help workers get better jobs and employers find the right workers for the workplace.

**Employer**

- Providing essential information for employers, including assessments of candidates skills and work experience, can help match qualified candidates with job openings and alleviate the challenges of the job search process.
- Using the app for wage and worker management can streamline the process and facilitate efficient management, ultimately reducing the workload and enabling more effective management practices.
- Providing education on labor rights can help raise awareness and improve understanding of these rights, ultimately contributing to better working conditions and treatment for workers.

**Employee**

- They can find the right job for them and find a stable and high-quality job.
- We aim to make resolution more accessible for those experiencing unfair treatment in the workplace.
- Protecting workers' rights, which includes ensuring fair treatment and implementing essential procedures like labor contracts, is crucial for promoting a just and equitable workplace.
- Ensuring fair treatment of workers and upholding basic rights, such as managing wages and work conditions, is essential for promoting a just and equitable workplace.

Signz expects that through these various functions, workers will be acknowledged for the value of their labor and that their working environment will be improved.
